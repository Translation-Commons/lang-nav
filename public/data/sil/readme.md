## Ethnologue 2012 Data

This data only includes language vitality estimates based on the EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) scale as of 2012. See https://www.ethnologue.com/methodology/#Status for more information about the EGIDS scale.

The file [ethnologue2012.tsv](/public/data/sil/ethnologue2012.tsv) contains data that was publicly shared on the Ethnologue website in 2012. It was acquired and used under the terms of the Ethnologue license at that time by the Digital Language Death project (András Kornai), used in their 2013 publication https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077056.

At the time, Ethnologue had 7,776 languages, but the data file contains 8,426 rows because some entries come from other datasets and were given manual vitality estimates by the Digital Language Death project.
